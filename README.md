# striatal_SPN_lib

This is the ispn branch of the repo.

This readme is UNDER CONSTRUCTION...

The example files included here does not add anything to the ones in the main branch 
(and will probably be removed)

The files used for simulation and analysis can be found under "Simulations".


Simulations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* the files in "Simulations" that include "run" in the name was used to run the simulations (mostly on supercomputers).
* the file.job was used to start the simulations (on Beskow PDC-KTH)
* functions4analysis.py ans plot.py were used to plot subpanels for fig 6 in Lindroos & H. K. 2020 (there is a similar file in the dspn repo---se "Genereal", below)



How to run the models (would need neuron+python installed, see below)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* UNDER CONSTRUCTION. INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE UPDATED...


Model software
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEURON+python: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download
(tested on version 7.5 and 7.6)


General (other models)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code for dspn is located in another repo:
https://bitbucket.org/rlindroos/neuron/src/cholinergic_modulation/Complex_spike/


Translated versions of the models in: 
    
    Hjorth et al., 2020. 
    The microcircuits of striatum in silico. PNAS
    
are also included (in the simulating_network_models branch ...and main?). See the included example file and the specific branch for these models.
